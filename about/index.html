<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I am a MSc student in Michael Hoffman's computational epigenomics lab at the University of Toronto.
  Previously, I obtained my HBSc from the University of Toronto in biological physics with a minor in mathematics.
  I am interested in 3D chromatin organization and how it contributes to disease.

  In my free time, I enjoy creating bioinformatics videos, learning Mandarin, and teaching myself new programming things!
  My other interests include: musical theatre, running, piano, astronomy, and hedgehogs.
